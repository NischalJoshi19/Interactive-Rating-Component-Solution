## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I took this challenge because rating component is used almost everywhere and I wanted to implement it using CSS trasform property. I had an idea of a card that rotates on pressing the submit button. I am not well-versed with the animation/transition/transform properties of CSS. Through this challenge I have been able to actually implement my idea. It is not a unique idea, not extra-ordinary or something along the lines, however, it is something that I wanted to implement and I have learned while doing it. It makes me feel good and I will be working more with animation/transition/transform properties of CSS moving forward.
